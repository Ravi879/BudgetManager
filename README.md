# BudgetManager 
 
This is a simple [BudgetManager](https://ravi879.github.io/BudgetManager/home.html) web application to calculate income and expense. You can add and remove the income or expense item  details. The application has 2 pages only, home.html for login & register and budget.php for the add and remove the item  details. 
<br>
The basic idea for the project is get from the udemy's JavaScript course “[The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/)“ by Jonas Schmedtmann. I have added the bootstrap and backend support.
